## Overview

The aim of this project is to provide Web Developers using `gatsby.js` the power to create cross-platform desktop apps using `electron`. 

#### What packages does the project use?
`electron` enables you to create desktop applications with pure JavaScript by providing a runtime with rich native (operating system) APIs. You could see it as a variant of the Node.js runtime that is focused on desktop applications instead of web servers.
<br />

`electron-builder` is used as a complete solution to package and build a ready for distribution (supports Numerous target formats) Electron app with "auto update" support out of the box.
<br />

`electron-serve` is used for Static file serving for Electron apps.
<br />

`gatsby.js` is used as a front-end technology for this Project.
<br />

`concurrently` is used to run multiple commands concurrently.
<br />

`wait-on` is used as it can wait for sockets, and http(s) resources to become available.
