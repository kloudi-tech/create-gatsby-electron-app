## Overview

The aim of this project is to provide Web Developers using `gatsby.js` the power to create cross-platform desktop apps using `electron`. 

`electron` enables you to create desktop applications with pure JavaScript by providing a runtime with rich native (operating system) APIs. You could see it as a variant of the Node.js runtime that is focused on desktop applications instead of web servers.
<br/>

`electron-builder` is used as a complete solution to package and build a ready for distribution (supports Numerous target formats) Electron app with “auto update” support out of the box.
<br/>

`electron-serve` is used for Static file serving for Electron apps.
<br/>

`gatsby.js` is used as a front-end technology for this Project.
<br/>

`concurrently` is used to run multiple commands concurrently.
<br/>

`wait-on` is used as it can wait for sockets, and http(s) resources to become available.
<br/>

<!-- The aim of this project is to remove the need of manually setting up electron apps using vue. electron-vue takes advantage of `vue-cli` for scaffolding, `webpack` with `vue-loader`, `electron-packager` or `electron-builder`, and some of the most used plugins like `vue-router`, `vuex`, and so much more. -->

<!-- # create-gatsby-electron-app
A simple starter project to get up and developing quickly with the blend of Gatsby and Electron JS for building a Native Desktop App on various OS Platforms like Windows, Linux and macOS using Electron Builder. -->
